  OS: Windows 11 Version 25H2 
  
  Runtime: Docker 29.1.5
  
  Database: PostgreSQL
  
  Brower: Mozilla Firefox  

**Assumptions & constraints:**  
- First time using Docker and OWASP Zap.

# 2️⃣ Executive Summary

**Short summary:** 
The web application’s user registration, input validation, and sensitive data handling mechanisms were tested. The zap scan found 2 high vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and Path Traversal. Manually, several critical and medium vulnerabilities were identified, including missing CSP header, weak or plain-text password storage, absence of CSRF protection, lack of domain validation, and weak password policies. Immediate remediation is recommended to protect user data and maintain system integrity and confidentiality.

**Overall risk level:** High

**Top 5 immediate actions:**

1. Encrypt Sensitive Data and Secure Error Handling
  Encrypt personal and authentication data both at rest and in transit using up-to-date algorithms.

2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set  
  Deploy a Content-Security-Policy header to restrict the loading of scripts, styles, and images to trusted domains only.

3. Secure Password Storage and Enforce Strong Password Policies
  Hash and salt all passwords using strong algorithms.
  Reject weak passwords, including blanks or trivial patterns.
  Encourage or require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all accounts.

4. Add CSRF Protection for Forms and Sensitive Actions
  Implement server-side anti-CSRF tokens for registration and other critical forms.
  Use double-submitted cookies or per-request tokens to validate user actions.

5. Validate and Restrict Input for Email and Other Fields
  Ensure only valid email domains are accepted.
  Reject clearly invalid or malformed data to prevent logical bypasses or errors.

# 3️⃣ Severity scale & definitions

|  **Severity Level**  | **Description**                                                                                                              | **Recommended Action**           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|      🔴 **High**     | A serious vulnerability that can lead to full system compromise or data breach (e.g., SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution). | *Immediate fix required*         |
|     🟠 **Medium**    | A significant issue that may require specific conditions or user interaction (e.g., XSS, CSRF).                              | *Fix ASAP*                       |
|      🟡 **Low**      | A minor issue or configuration weakness (e.g., server version disclosure).                                                   | *Fix soon*                       |
| 🔵 **Info** | No direct risk, but useful for system hardening (e.g., missing security headers).                                            | *Monitor and fix in maintenance* |

# 4️⃣ Findings (filled with examples → replace)


| ID | Severity | Finding | Description | Evidence / Proof |
|------|-----------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| F-01 | 🔴 High | Plain-text password storage | The database stores passwords without any hashing or encryption. |SELECT * FROM booking_users; shows readable passwords <img width="912" height="167" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9074e856-479a-4ccc-8fcc-6b3d45135aa7" />|
| F-02 | 🟠 Medium | Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set | The website is vulnerable to XSS attacks, which could allow the execution of malicious scripts in users' browsers | Missing CSP Header on Burp: <img width="935" height="307" alt="CSP" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36e102c8-d5ad-47b6-b97a-7800bf9e151a" />|
| F-03 | 🟠 Medium | Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens | The CSRF token is non-existent on the server side | No mention of the token on the request <img width="1390" height="1044" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9eb9d56-5b79-410f-9451-0fa98e26e56b" />|
| F-04 | 🟡 Low | Lack of Domain Validation | The system accepts fake email domains (ex: @abcde) | Registration successful with non-existent domain @qfknlfv <img width="912" height="167" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d47a297-4be1-4916-9b69-3dfc15daa552" />|
